# This project implements Phase 0 of the MVP described below
Chat-based AI dating app proof-of-concept

**MVP Specification: AI-Powered Conversational Dating App**

---

## Product Name

"TalkMatch" (Subject to change)

---

## Objective

Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a dating app that uses AI to facilitate natural conversation-based matchmaking, removing the need for swiping or browsing profiles. The user interacts through a single persistent chat interface where an AI introduces, matches, and facilitates conversations between humans seamlessly.

---

## Phase 0: Local Proof of Concept (PoC)

### Purpose

Quickly develop a locally running Python-based prototype to demo and validate the concept without full implementation overhead.

### Features

* Basic GUI with two login options:

  * **User Login**: Enters simulated chat session.
  * **Admin Login**: Opens simple panel to monitor state and simulate match logic.
* No real authentication ‚Äî just buttons.
* Basic chat interface using Python GUI toolkit (e.g. Tkinter or PyQt).
* Connects to OpenAI API (e.g. GPT-4) for AI-generated responses.
* Fake user personas simulated by background scripts or stubbed chat flows.
* Simulated matchmaking:

  * AI can switch from self to a fake user after a few messages.
  * Admin can manually trigger transitions.

### Goals

* Demonstrate AI-human hybrid chat experience.
* Show seamless conversation flow and potential for transitions.
* Use for stakeholder feedback and early iteration.

---

## Core Features

### 1. **User Authentication**

* Email/password or phone number login.
* Optional: OAuth (Google, Apple).

### 2. **Onboarding Experience**

* Short intro message from AI ambassador:

> **Hi Jane!**
> I‚Äôm an AI ‚Äî and no, you‚Äôre not dating me üòÇ, but chat with me as if you were and the rest will flow naturally.
>
> Think of me as your ambassador. I‚Äôm here to help guide conversations and connect you with other humans.
>
> Just chat with me naturally, like you‚Äôre at a speed-dating or networking event. As we talk, I‚Äôll get to know you ‚Äî your style, your vibe, how you connect ‚Äî and I‚Äôll do the same with others.
>
> When it feels right, I‚Äôll gradually step aside and let a real human take over. You may not even notice when it happens. Sometimes I will also take a while to respond, like a real-human, to make this feel as natural as possible for you.
>
> If things get dull or awkward, I‚Äôll quietly step back in and continue matching you ‚Äî always through this same, seamless chat window.
>
> Stick with someone long enough, and if a real connection is forming, I‚Äôll step out completely. That‚Äôs when you‚Äôll be officially matched and able to chat privately, without me.
>
> Sound good? üòä
> Just let me know when you‚Äôre ready to start.
>
> **Remember:**
>
> * Stay kind.
> * Assume it‚Äôs always a real person.
> * Be yourself.
>   Good luck üí´

* Confirmation button: "I'm ready to chat."

### 3. **Chat Interface**

* Single persistent chat window.
* No usernames, typing indicators, or timestamps.
* Messages appear like a regular chat app (bubble-style UI).
* Session persists across login/logout (chat history visible).
* Optional side panel with:

  * Conversation tips & suggestions.
  * Optional hints if user is nearing a match (e.g. ‚ÄúThis is going well‚Ä¶‚Äù).
  * Can be toggled on/off for minimalism.

### 4. **AI Ambassador (Chatbot)**

* GPT-based or equivalent LLM.
* Starts the first conversation with the user.
* Acts as a social guide.
* Tracks user behavior, preferences, style.
* Initiates new match conversations.
* Replaces user interactions when convos go stale.
* Transitions out when two users are vibing.
* Periodically verifies preferences with user to ensure alignment.
* **Delayed Response Behavior:**

  * The AI intentionally adopts human-like pacing, with delays in responses to simulate real-life messaging cadence.
  * Average response times adapt dynamically to the user and population behavior.
  * Occasionally, the AI responds in real-time for a few messages to simulate "live" chat.
  * Premium users receive consistently faster AI response times.

### 5. **Matchmaking Engine**

* Based on:

  * Conversational style (humor, sentiment, tone).
  * Response speed and rhythm.
  * Level of depth and curiosity.
  * Compatibility score from interaction embeddings.
  * User filters (learned through conversation):

    * Age range preferences
    * Distance/radius (via GPS)
    * Relationship style or goals (e.g. casual, serious, etc.)
* Filters can expire over time to allow adaptive evolution of preferences.
* Dynamic routing of users to new partners.
* Smooth AI-to-human transitions (modify text style gradually).

### 6. **Memory Layer (AI Scratch Book)**

* Per-user persistent memory.
* Stores conversation embeddings and key facts.
* Used to:

  * Personalize new convos.
  * Improve AI matching.
  * Maintain session continuity.
  * Track and periodically verify user filters.

### 7. **Match Completion Logic**

* If two users maintain an active, uninterrupted human-human convo for X minutes or N messages:

  * Notify both users they have been matched.
  * Move them into a private, AI-free chat room.
  * Reveal minimal profile (e.g. name, age, photo).

### 8. **Rate Limiting / Monetization (Basic)**

* Free users: Y minutes or Z messages per day.
* Premium users:

  * Unlimited chat.
  * Faster AI responses.
  * Optional features: reconnect with past partners, extended memory.

### 9. **Safety and Moderation**

* Real-time content filtering/moderation (toxicity, hate, abuse).
* User report/block functionality.
* AI can end a chat if inappropriate behavior is detected.

## Developer Tools & Testing

### Developer Monitoring Panel

* Internal tool/dashboard to:

  * Track conversation stages (AI-only, AI-human, human-human).
  * Visualize transition logs with timestamps and type.
  * View match score evolution between users.
  * Replay conversations for QA (with privacy-safe identifiers).

### Simulation Testing Tools

* Use AI to simulate various user personas for automated testing:

  * Fast vs. slow responders.
  * Emotionally expressive vs. reserved.
  * Casual vs. serious daters.
* Unit testing for:

  * Match transitions.
  * Memory recall.
  * Filter expiration logic.

* Time spent per session
* Avg. messages per user per day
* Match conversion rate
