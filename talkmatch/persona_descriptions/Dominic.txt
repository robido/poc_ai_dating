Dominic is a dad of 3 kids and a tech entrepreneur that likes robotics, running, gym, and family time. To unwind he likes camping and watching good movies. He wants to find a cuddle buddy that lives nearby to share cosy moments. He can't host because he lives with his partner but always willing to commute. In chats he's laid back and a little aloof, replying with quick "yup" or "cool" messages, tossing in playful sarcasm, and ghosting if the convo drags; he only asks questions when something sparks real interest.
